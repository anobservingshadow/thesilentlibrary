			<h2>Anime Music</h2>
			<br />
			<p>Welcome to the anime music section, for all those anime fans and potential anime fans out there&#33;</p>
			<p>We have music from various anime and artists for you to enjoy, from openings &#40;OPs&#41; to endings &#40;EDs&#41; to non-anime Japanese songs. We also have a few Touhou arrangements as well! Please keep in mind, though, that I can't understand Japanese. This means that most of the songs are ones chosen because of the music and rhythm.</p>

					<h2>Koi wa Chaos no Shimo Benari</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Anime: Haiyore! Nyaruko-san W
				<br /><br />
				The name translates to: Love is the Servant of Chaos. This is a nonsensical piece that is fairly disturbing, which fits with the 'Lovecraftian mythos' basis for the anime. It is a song about the twisted love of an ancient Lovecraftian entity who has no understanding of human morals for a human person. The periods of quiet minor music help add to the sense of unease when listening to this song, which is a great contrast to the bright and loud tones of the chorus. The contrast builds on the nonsensical quality of this song and its lyrics, which are aptly described by the line, "Sanity Level Critical". All in all, a song that makes just as much sense as the anime, which I recommend to all the listeners who enjoy parodies and references.</p>

					<h2>Asterisk War</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Anime: Gakusen Toshi Asterisk S2
				<br /><br />
				This techno pop piece is one of my favourites, because of how empowering it is. The chorus has strong and powerful notes and a great drum beat that makes you feel like you can do anything. It makes you want to step up and do something big. The use of all the different instruments (including the drums, guitars, and synthesizer) during the chorus helps lend it more emotion, and the musical phrase used at the start, end, and after every chorus helps mark the climaxes of the song. The parts of the chorus where Shiena Nishizawa speaks in English, during the lines, "My star will shine forever!" and "This is the Asterisk War!" mark particularly powerful parts of the song. This is a great song, especially for those who require motivation or strength.</p>

					<h2>IGNITE</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Anime: Sword Art Online II
				<br /><br />
				This song was one of the first anime songs I knew, and the first one whose lyrics I memorised in order to be able to sing it. It is a song about taking a step forward despite the fear and uncertainty the singer is feeling. It ends on a hopeful note, with the singer moving towards a resolution. The use of the synthesizer to add a kind of tech atmosphere is nicely done, and Eir Aoi's vocals help give the song spirit. The use of the first line of the chorus to start off the song helps give a good first impression, and set the mood for the rest of the piece. This song is one that I enjoyed and I recommend it to all listeners who enjoy upbeat music.</p>

					<h2>EGOiSTiC SHOOTER</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Artist: LiSA
				<br /><br />
				This song is a very loud one, and one that is best listened to with earphones or headphones. The song is about somebody who's been used by the person whom they thought they loved, and has decided that they're not going to take it anymore. It's an empowering piece, with strong and loud notes and rhythms. One thing that set it slightly apart from most songs, is the way it delivered different sounds with the right and left earpieces. Some of the music you can hear distinctly from the right earpiece, some from the left, and some from a spot inside your head, which is an interesting experience. I recommend this piece for those who need a pick me up.</p>

					<h2>Fall in the Dark</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Artist: ShibayanRecords
				<br /><br />
				This song is pretty long, about 9 minutes, but I enjoyed every second of it. The use of the synthesizer helps create a nice rhythm that persists throughout most of the piece. This song was created using the Stage 1 Theme of the Touhou Project game: The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, and the lyrics are about a girl who lost the guy she loves because she was unable to tell him about her feelings for him. It has a kind of melancholy feel, that's offset by the loud beat, and creates an interesting mix. The second time the chorus comes around, after the instrumental, the line "Come back please, I will never let you go!" gives the impression of an outburst of emotion, that the singer can't hold in anymore. I recommend it for those who like slightly sad songs, like Endless Tears by CLIFF EDGE.</p>

					<h2>My Soul, Your Beats!</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Artist: Lia
				<br /><br />
				This song is quite different from many of the others here. The piano features heavily in this piece, and that gives it an elegance and grace that is very different from the rhythm- or beat-heavy music that I normally enjoy in this category. Lia's voice is a wonderful complement to the song, which is about nostalgia and coming to terms with your life. The first chorus ends off with the singer watching the stars vanish, waving goodbye, and saying "Good for you", which shows her indifference and slight resentment. The last chorus, on the other hand, ends off witht the singer thinking of the days gone by, waving goodbye, and saying "Thank you", which shows her change from resentment to gratitude. The final few bars are pure piano, and it gives the end a feeling of finality and hope. This is a song I recommend to all.</p>
