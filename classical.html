					<h2>Sonata No. 8 in C Minor, Pathetique", 1st Movement</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Artist: Ludwig van Beethoven
				<br /><br />
				Despite the name, this song is anything but pathetic. This piece is very powerful, with the strong notes and a melody that's almost staccato at times, with many notes or sets of notes being distinctive and easy to tell from others. It starts off fairly slow and soft, with the power increasing in bursts, with the song calming down in between. Right before the end, the song calms down until its incredibly quiet, before quickly increasing in volume and ending with a several strong notes. It's a great piece that I recommend to all.</p>

					<h2>Symphony No. 40, 1st Movement, "Allegro"</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Artist: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
				<br /><br />
				This is one of Mozart's most famous works, and it definitely deserves the fame. It's a calming piece, that has periodic outbursts of uplifting emotion. It builds up into a crescendo, before dropping back down to a more relaxing volume, and then repeats again and again. The process reminds one of a story, with its rising action and multiple climaxes, all building up into a satisfying conclusion. The brief lull in which the violins all quieten during the final climax was a nice touch. The song also gives me, personally, a sense of nostalgia that cements it firmly as a 5 star piece.</p>

					<h2>Ride of the Valkyries</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Artist: Richard Wagner
				<br /><br />
				This work of art is one of the most known songs out there, and is iconic as an accompaniment to scenes of heroism, especially in helicopters. This was because of its use in the 1979 film, Apocalypse Now, in which it was played during a helicopter attack on an enemy village. The song is made up of climax after climax, as more and more instruments join in, increasing the power and strength of the song. The use of the violins throughout the song helps provide a sense of tension to accompany the powerful timbre of the horns, which gives the idea of bravery and courage in the face of danger. The occasional times when the horns quieten and the violins help build up an ambience which highlights when the horns come back on. This is a great song for those who need inspiration.</p>

					<h2>Valse Op. 64, No. 1 "Minute Waltz"</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Artist: Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Chopin
				<br /><br />
				This minute (minute as in small, not in terms of time) piece is one that requires a great amount of precision, dexterity, and speed to play. The piece is characterized by the rapid melody, punctuated by sudden bursts in which the melody swiftly climbs a few octaves, before returning to its original position. It gives the impression of a dolphin swimming in the sea, that occasionally leaps high out of the water, before continuing on. The piece slows down temporarily near the middle, coming to a momentary stop, before the speed jumps once again, as the dolphin regains its energy and is ready to start playing around once more. A wonderful piece that I recommend to all.</p>

					<h2>Clair de Lune</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Artist: Claude Debussy
				<br /><br />
				This is a very relaxing piece, but emotional piece. The soft and smooth notes of the string and wind instruments do a very good job of creating an atmosphere of peace and serenity. It brings to mind a quiet walk in the forest, just taking in the wonder of nature and its boundless beauty. Unlike many of the other pieces, it is quiet and calm throughout the entire song, without any climaxes or large increases in volume, yet the notes are still powerful enough to leave a strong impression on the listener. This is a good song for relaxing the mind, whether during times of stress or rest.</p>

					<h2>La Campanella</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Artist: Franz Liszt
				<br /><br />
				This is a masterful piece, and the precision required is nothing short of astounding. The use of the right hand to play two different melodies gives it a unique feel that few, if any, other composers have. It makes me think of a quiet mouse trying to creep by a cat, as it starts with generally high and quiet notes, like a mouse's creeping. The bass, on the other hand, is quiet, like a sleeping cat. The right hand gets faster and louder, as the mouse becomes more confident, until a sharp burst of staccato notes resound as the cat wakes up. Then both the melody and the bass play as the cat chases the mouse around, with the outcome not clearly defined by the song. It's a very intriguing piece, and one that I recommend to most people.</p>
