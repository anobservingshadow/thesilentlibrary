					<h2>My Favourite Things</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Musical: The Sound of Music
				<br /><br />
				A carefree and happy song about the power of memory and optimism. The repetition of the verses is relaxing, and the simplicity allows the listener to think about other things than the song itself. The chorus talks about thinking about happier things during times of difficulty in order to feel better. However, this idea is simply born out of na&#239;vet&#233;, because thinking about happy things may give you a brief memory of bliss, but being brought back to the dark reality of the situation will be all the more painful. As they say, the higher you go, the harder you fall. This song is much the same, trying to provide a brief distraction for you. However, many people need this distraction, this brief moment of respite, in order to find the strength to continue on their current path. Recommended for those going through hard times.</p>

					<h2>America</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Musical: West Side Story
				<br /><br />
				This song is an interesting piece that employs a mixed 6-8 3-4 meter, which is one of its distinctive characteristics. At first listen, this song is lighthearted and full of laughter and smiles, but a closer look at the song's lyrics reveal a darker undertone. The lyrics speak of the discrimination against Puerto Ricans in America, as one set of singers speak about the positive qualities of life in America, and the other speaks of the negative. Lyrics like, "Buying on credit is nice." "One look at us and they charge twice." hint subtly at the racism, while other lines are more obvious, e.g. "Life is all right in America." "If you're all white in America." The irony is that the song is done in a Hispanic musical style, despite the apparent pro-American lyrics.</p>

					<h2>Bohemian Rhapsody</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Artist: Queen
				<br /><br />
				This is an interesting song that really doesn't follow the norm. The song is about a young man who committed murder, and the events that occur afterward. There is no main chorus, instead it details events through musical dialogue. The first few verses are like a letter from the young man to his family, and then it suddenly cuts to what seems to be his capture and subsequent arrest. After that, it switches to a seeming dialogue between the young man, an audience protesting his execution, and the police who arrested him. The last verse is the young man, resigning himself to his fate, before deciding to go "anyway the wind blows." The music and pitch varies wildly, as events progress and the speaker switches. It's an interesting piece, that I recommend to those looking for something new.</p>

					<h2>Phoenix</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Artist: Fall Out Boy
				<br /><br />
				A very beat-heavy song, that seems to be about going against the system. It barely makes any sense, but it seems to be about rebelling against the world and doing what you want. Despite not making any sense, it's an incredibly motivating song that makes you want to go and do something. The rhythm is very catchy, and the use of violins gives the song even more power than before. The violins used at both the start and end help set up and close the song. This is a very catchy piece that is currently stuck in my head and will be for a while. I recommend it to those who enjoy empowering music.</p>

					<h2>Radioactive</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Artist: Imagine Dragons
				<br /><br />
				This song is okay. It's about what appears to be a man living after the apocalypse. He appears to be trying to go against the system, and do things his way. While the lyrics don't make much sense to me, the beat is very catchy, and the synthesizer is used well. It is an empowering song, about the singer being 'radioactive', which I'm assuming signifies the power that the singer feels. The chorus makes a good piece for an awarding of a certificate or when declaring the winner of an event.</p>

					<h2>Gone, Gone, Gone</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Artist: Phillip Phillips
				<br /><br />
				This is a heartwarming song about unconditional love, that doesn't change even in the face of rejection and a break up, or even death. The guitar lends it a homely and casual feel, and also adds a slight romantic element to the song. The multiple people singing during the chorus makes it even more moving, and enhances the casual feel. The use of the drums during the lines "like a drum, baby, don't stop beating" is a nice touch. The use of other percussion instruments like maracas and tambourines help add to the atmosphere. The emphasis on the words "for you" help highlight the singer's feelings, that they would not do these things for anybody else. This is a beautiful song and I recommend it to everybody. While you're listening, think about the people who matter to you, and what you would do for them.</p>
