				<h2>Symphony No. 40, 1st Movement, "Allegro"</h2>
			</article>
			<p>Artist: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
			<br /><br />
			This is one of Mozart's most famous works, and it definitely deserves the fame. It's a calming piece, that has periodic outbursts of uplifting emotion. It builds up into a crescendo, before dropping back down to a more relaxing volume, and then repeats again and again. The process reminds one of a story, with its rising action and multiple climaxes, all building up into a satisfying conclusion. The brief lull in which the violins all quieten during the final climax was a nice touch. The song also gives me, personally, a sense of nostalgia that cements it firmly as a 5 star piece.</p>

					<h2>My Favourite Things</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Musical: The Sound of Music
				<br /><br />
				A carefree and happy song about the power of memory and optimism. The repetition of the verses is relaxing, and the simplicity allows the listener to think about other things than the song itself. The chorus talks about thinking about happier things during times of difficulty in order to feel better. However, this idea is simply born out of na&#239;vet&#233;, because thinking about happy things may give you a brief memory of bliss, but being brought back to the dark reality of the situation will be all the more painful. As they say, the higher you go, the harder you fall. This song is much the same, trying to provide a brief distraction for you. However, many people need this distraction, this brief moment of respite, in order to find the strength to continue on their current path. Recommended for those going through hard times.</p>

					<h2>Koi wa Chaos no Shimo Benari</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Anime: Haiyore! Nyaruko-san W
				<br /><br />
				The name translates to: Love is the Servant of Chaos. This is a nonsensical piece that is fairly disturbing, which fits with the 'Lovecraftian mythos' basis for the anime. It is a song about the twisted love of an ancient Lovecraftian entity who has no understanding of human morals for a human person. The periods of quiet minor music help add to the sense of unease when listening to this song, which is a great contrast to the bright and loud tones of the chorus. The contrast builds on the nonsensical quality of this song and its lyrics, which are aptly described by the line, "Sanity Level Critical". All in all, a song that makes just as much sense as the anime, which I recommend to all the listeners who enjoy parodies and references.</p>
