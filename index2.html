				<h2>Ride of the Valkyries</h2>
			</article>
			<p>Artist: Richard Wagner
			<br /><br />
			This work of art is one of the most known songs out there, and is iconic as an accompaniment to scenes of heroism, especially in helicopters. This was because of its use in the 1979 film, Apocalypse Now, in which it was played during a helicopter attack on an enemy village. The song is made up of climax after climax, as more and more instruments join in, increasing the power and strength of the song. The use of the violins throughout the song helps provide a sense of tension to accompany the powerful timbre of the horns, which gives the idea of bravery and courage in the face of danger. The occasional times when the horns quieten and the violins help build up an ambience which highlights when the horns come back on. This is a great song for those who need inspiration.</p>

					<h2>Bohemian Rhapsody</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Artist: Queen
				<br /><br />
				This is an interesting song that really doesn't follow the norm. The song is about a young man who committed murder, and the events that occur afterward. There is no main chorus, instead it details events through musical dialogue. The first few verses are like a letter from the young man to his family, and then it suddenly cuts to what seems to be his capture and subsequent arrest. After that, it switches to a seeming dialogue between the young man, an audience protesting his execution, and the police who arrested him. The last verse is the young man, resigning himself to his fate, before deciding to go "anyway the wind blows." The music and pitch varies wildly, as events progress and the speaker switches. It's an interesting piece, that I recommend to those looking for something new.</p>

					<h2>IGNITE</h2>
				</article>
				<p>Anime: Sword Art Online II
				<br /><br />
				This song was one of the first anime songs I knew, and the first one whose lyrics I memorised in order to be able to sing it. It is a song about taking a step forward despite the fear and uncertainty the singer is feeling. It ends on a hopeful note, with the singer moving towards a resolution. The use of the synthesizer to add a kind of tech atmosphere is nicely done, and Eir Aoi's vocals help give the song spirit. The use of the first line of the chorus to start off the song helps give a good first impression, and set the mood for the rest of the piece. This song is one that I enjoyed and I recommend it to all listeners who enjoy upbeat music.</p>
