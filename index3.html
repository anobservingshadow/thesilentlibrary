				<h2>Clair de Lune</h2>
			</article>
			<p>Artist: Claude Debussy
			<br /><br />
			This is a very relaxing piece, but emotional piece. The soft and smooth notes of the string and wind instruments do a very good job of creating an atmosphere of peace and serenity. It brings to mind a quiet walk in the forest, just taking in the wonder of nature and its boundless beauty. Unlike many of the other pieces, it is quiet and calm throughout the entire song, without any climaxes or large increases in volume, yet the notes are still powerful enough to leave a strong impression on the listener. This is a good song for relaxing the mind, whether during times of stress or rest.</p>

				<h2>Radioactive</h2>
			</article>
			<p>Artist: Imagine Dragons
			<br /><br />
			This song is okay. It's about what appears to be a man living after the apocalypse. He appears to be trying to go against the system, and do things his way. While the lyrics don't make much sense to me, the beat is very catchy, and the synthesizer is used well. It is an empowering song, about the singer being 'radioactive', which I'm assuming signifies the power that the singer feels. The chorus makes a good piece for an awarding of a certificate or when declaring the winner of an event.</p>

				<h2>Fall in the Dark</h2>
			</article>
			<p>Artist: ShibayanRecords
			<br /><br />
			This song is pretty long, about 9 minutes, but I enjoyed every second of it. The use of the synthesizer helps create a nice rhythm that persists throughout most of the piece. This song was created using the Stage 1 Theme of the Touhou Project game: The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, and the lyrics are about a girl who lost the guy she loves because she was unable to tell him about her feelings for him. It has a kind of melancholy feel, that's offset by the loud beat, and creates an interesting mix. The second time the chorus comes around, after the instrumental, the line "Come back please, I will never let you go!" gives the impression of an outburst of emotion, that the singer can't hold in anymore. I recommend it for those who like slightly sad songs, like Endless Tears by CLIFF EDGE.</p>
